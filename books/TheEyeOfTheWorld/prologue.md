title: Prologue - Dragonmount
---

The series begins in a palace that is shaking and crumbling.  Dead bodies of men, women, and children are lying everywhere. A man named Lews Therin Telamon is wandering around, calling for his wife Ilyena.  It's clear that something is wrong with Lews Therin, since despite the devastation, he laughs delightedly while calling for his wife. He has a symbol on his cloak, "a circle half white and half black, the colors separated by a sinuous line".

A man dressed in black magically appears and calls for Lews Therin, naming him "Lord of the Morning."  When Lews Therin greets him as a guest, the man in black realizes "the taint" has made Lews Therin insane.  He curses (using the name Shai'tan), and demands for Lews Therin to remember what has happened.

When Lews Therin says he doesn't know the man, the man in black gives his previous name as Elan Morin Tedronai.  Lews Therin briefly remembers that Elan was named "Betrayer of Hope".  The Betrayer of Hope replies that he embraces the name given to him, unlike Lews Therin, who was given the title "Dragon".  The man in black remarks that now the Dragon will be known as Kinslayer.

Elan continues to mock Lews Therin. He describes how the Dragon was once "first among the Servants", "wore the Ring of Tamyrlin", "sat in the High Seat", and "summoned the Nine Rods of Dominion".  But despite "humbl[ing] me in the Hall of Servants" and "defeat[ing] me at the Gates of Paaran Disen", Elan states he himself is now the greater of the two.

When Lews Therin starts babbling about Elan being a guest and continues to call for his wife, Elan decides to temporarily heal the man's madness.  Remarking that the Dragon's "Sisters" could have given better healing, Elan uses magic that seems to darken the room and directs it at Lews Therin.  This causes immense agony to the Dragon, who screams in pain.  After the pain recedes, a now-lucid Lews Therin realizes that his wife is dead on the floor right in front of him.

Elan tells Lews Therin that he can have his wife back if he will serve "The Great Lord of the Dark".  The Dragon angrily replies that Elan and his "foul master" have tormented the world for the last ten years.  This causes Elan to rant that the war has not lasted ten years, but rather that the two of them have fought literally a million times as the Wheel of Time has turned.  He concludes that they will continue to fight until "time dies and the Shadow is triumphant".

Lews Therin tells Betrayer that since Elan killed his wife Ilyena, he will "destroy you beyond anything your master can repair."  However, Elan interrupts him and commands him to remember.  "Remember your futile attack on the Great Lord of the Dark!  Remember his counter-stroke!"  He says the Hundred Companions are now tearing the world apart, and so are many other men.  He continues, "What hand slew Ilyena Sunhair, Kinslayer? Not mine. Not mine. What hand struck down every life that bore a drop of your blood, everyone who loved you, everyone you loved? Not mine, Kinslayer. Not mine."

Now Lews Therin remembers and howls in grief and rage.  In his madness, he was the one who killed his whole family.  He can't stand it anymore and uses the "True Source", "tainted *saidin*", and Travels to a different location.

Kinslayer calls out to the Light to forgive him but doesn't believe he can be forgiven.  He reflects on *saidin*, which is the "male half of the power that drove the universe, that turned the Wheel of Time".  He knows *saidin* was tainted by "the Shadow's counterstroke", and he knows it's his own fault.  He has doomed the world because he believed that men could "mend what the Creator had made".

Lews Therin draws more of the One Power "than he could channel unaided" and tries to draw it all.  He screams "Light, forgive me! Ilyena!" and calls down a giant bolt of white hot fire out of the heavens directly at himself.  It completely obliterates him and drills deep into the earth.  Immediately, lava begins to shoot out of it, blasting higher and higher, forming into a very tall mountain.  Far to the side of the mountain, a nearby river is disrupted and splits into two with an island in the middle.

Elan, Betrayer of Hope, appears on the island and looks across the river at the new mountain, Dragonmount.  He says, "You cannot escape so easily, Dragon. It is not done between us.  It will not be done until the end of time."
