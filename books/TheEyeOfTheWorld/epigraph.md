There is a quotation from a book called *The Breaking of the World*, written in the fourth age.  It describes calamities and destruction which broke the world.  All that remains is memory, particularly of the one named Dragon, who brought the Shadow and the Breaking of the World. 

There is a quotation from a book called *The Cycle of the Dragon*, written in the fourth age.  It describes a dark time when hope was dying.  People "cried out to the Creator, saying, O Light of the Heavens, Light of the World, let the Promised One be born", referring to this Promised One as "Prince of the Morning" and "Lord of the Dawn".  It concludes, "Let the Dragon ride again on the winds of time."
